# BaseFramework
Modified Implementation of GTGDS3, which I made for my game Expunge!

##Contents
Modules that perform following functions (pretty much everything uses delegation model)
Each Master Script handles overall function of each module
Each Module has scripts that refers to it's master script while working together
with other scripts of the same module and different but connected module.

```
* [Master Scipts]

* Game Management
* Player Management
* Item Management
* Item as Destructible Items
* Item as Guns
* Item as Melee Weapons

* Enemy Management (delegation model)

* Additional Scripts for Expunge

* Additional Scripts which were used in prototyping

# Expunge! v1.2 01-01-2018
```
Expunge is a Procedurally generated FPS Arcade.
All levels are randomly generated with enemies spawning with one objective, 
Find and eliminate the Player. Fight through a lair of Golems with Guns and Ammo. 
Pick up Health when you're hurt and score points for each enemy eliminated.
